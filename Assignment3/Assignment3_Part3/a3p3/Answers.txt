Question:
Compile the code and boot the RPi using the newly created kernel, i.e., a3p3.img.
Does it work? Create a file called Answers.txt and the explanation for why this new kernel is not working as expected.

Answer:
No, it does not work. Since the thread only has 5 set as the maximum limit, calling spawn 6 times won't work. #define NTHREADS	5.
Also that we created a switch case that will return "Invalid segment" if passing a higher segment than 3. (Quadrants)
