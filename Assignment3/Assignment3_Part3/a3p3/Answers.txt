Compile the code and boot the RPi using the newly created kernel, i.e., a3p3.img.
Does it work? Create a file called Answers.txt and the explanation for why this new kernel is not working as expected.

Since the thread only have 5 as maximum limit, but calling spawn 6 times it wont work. #define NTHREADS	5.
Also that we created a switch case, that will return "Invalid segment" if passing higher segment then 3.
